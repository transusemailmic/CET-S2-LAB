How to run the shell file?

Even Spaces matter in shell scripting. There should be a single space between the brackets and variables too.. so keep that in mind.

The Shell Scropt need not be in sh file. It can be directly written line by line in the shell and run too.

But in my opinion typing in some text editor first and then copy pasting the content to the shell file is better

Typing file directly in shell
Use nano filename.sh or cat > filename.sh
Or simply create a file using touch filename.sh

nano and cat > are the two ways. in my opinion the nano is best...
Copy the contents of the VScode and right click in the shell, then only it will get pasted. otherwise it wont get pasted.

To save a file in cat use Ctrl+D shortcut but in nano saving file is Ctrl+O.. so keep these in mind.

Now to run the sh file.. two ways:
1. ./filename.sh
2. bash filename.sh

Note: simply filename.sh wont work. Another thing is that you want to change the permission of the file for execution.
You have to use the below command for enabling execution

chmod 777 filename.sh or chmod a+rwx filename.sh
